# SINProtection
A simple Java program that protects the Canadian sin number from being revealed

This program consists of 2 static recursive methods with the following descriptions:

### Public static boolean Check (String sin)
A static recursive method that determines whether or not the string sin only contains digits 0-9

### Public static int Hash (String sin)
A static recursive method that returns the hash value (sum of all the digits) of the input sin string





Using this program is free and no copyright is needed. 

Enjoy :)
